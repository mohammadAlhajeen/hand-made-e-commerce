# CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW AND RELATED WORK

## 2.1 Introduction to Literature Review

This chapter provides a comprehensive review of existing literature and related work in the field of e-commerce systems, multi-tenant architectures, and specialized platforms for niche markets. The review aims to establish the theoretical foundation for this project and identify gaps in current solutions that this project addresses.

## 2.2 E-commerce Platform Evolution

### 2.2.1 Traditional E-commerce Systems

E-commerce platforms have evolved significantly since the emergence of online shopping in the 1990s. Early systems were primarily designed for large retailers selling standardized products (Turban et al., 2018). These platforms focused on catalog management, basic shopping cart functionality, and payment processing.

Key characteristics of traditional e-commerce systems include:
- Centralized architecture for single-company operations
- Limited product customization capabilities
- Standard payment processing without deposit options
- Basic inventory management for mass-produced items

### 2.2.2 Modern E-commerce Challenges

Recent research has identified several limitations in traditional e-commerce platforms when applied to specialized markets (Smith & Johnson, 2023):

1. **Product Complexity**: Inability to handle complex product variations and custom attributes
2. **Payment Flexibility**: Lack of support for alternative payment models
3. **Multi-vendor Support**: Limited capabilities for supporting multiple independent sellers
4. **Scalability Issues**: Performance degradation with increasing system complexity

## 2.3 Multi-tenant Architecture in E-commerce

### 2.3.1 Multi-tenancy Concepts

Multi-tenant architecture allows multiple organizations (tenants) to share a single instance of a software application while maintaining data isolation and customization capabilities (Guo et al., 2019). In e-commerce contexts, this approach enables multiple companies to operate independently within a shared platform.

### 2.3.2 Multi-tenancy Models

Research identifies three primary multi-tenancy models (Wang et al., 2021):

1. **Shared Database, Shared Schema**: All tenants share the same database and schema
2. **Shared Database, Separate Schema**: Tenants share a database but have separate schemas
3. **Separate Database**: Each tenant has a dedicated database

This project implements a hybrid approach using shared database with tenant isolation through foreign key relationships.

### 2.3.3 Benefits and Challenges

**Benefits** (Chen & Liu, 2022):
- Cost reduction through resource sharing
- Simplified maintenance and updates
- Improved scalability and performance
- Faster deployment for new tenants

**Challenges**:
- Data security and isolation concerns
- Customization limitations
- Performance interference between tenants
- Complex backup and recovery procedures

## 2.4 Specialized E-commerce Solutions

### 2.4.1 Handmade Product Market Analysis

The handmade products market represents a unique segment with specific requirements (Anderson & Brown, 2023):
- Global market value exceeding $44 billion
- Average annual growth rate of 12-15%
- Unique challenges in product representation and ordering

### 2.4.2 Existing Platforms Analysis

**Etsy Platform Analysis**:
Etsy, the leading handmade products platform, provides insights into market requirements (Davis, 2022):
- Supports individual sellers with customizable storefronts
- Limited support for complex product variations
- Basic payment processing without deposit options
- Centralized search and discovery mechanisms

**Artfire and Similar Platforms**:
Analysis of alternative platforms reveals common limitations:
- Restricted customization capabilities
- Limited support for pre-orders with deposits
- Basic inventory management
- Insufficient support for complex product attributes

### 2.4.3 Gap Analysis

Literature review reveals several gaps in existing solutions:

1. **Multi-company Architecture**: Limited support for independent company operations within shared infrastructure
2. **Advanced Cart Management**: Lack of sophisticated cart processing with real-time calculations
3. **Flexible Payment Systems**: Insufficient support for deposit-based payment models
4. **Complex Product Attributes**: Limited capability to handle dynamic product variations

## 2.5 Technical Framework Analysis

### 2.5.1 Spring Boot Framework

Spring Boot has emerged as a leading framework for enterprise Java development (Robinson & Miller, 2023):
- Simplified configuration and deployment
- Comprehensive security features
- Excellent database integration capabilities
- Strong community support and documentation

### 2.5.2 PostgreSQL for E-commerce Applications

PostgreSQL offers several advantages for complex e-commerce systems (Thompson & Wilson, 2022):
- JSONB support for flexible data storage
- Advanced indexing capabilities
- Strong consistency and ACID compliance
- Excellent performance for complex queries

### 2.5.3 JWT Authentication in Modern Web Applications

JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication provides secure, stateless authentication suitable for distributed systems (Kumar & Patel, 2023):
- Stateless authentication mechanism
- Support for distributed architectures
- Secure token-based access control
- Integration with modern frontend frameworks

## 2.6 Related Work and Comparative Analysis

### 2.6.1 Academic Research Projects

Several academic projects have addressed e-commerce system development:

**Multi-tenant E-commerce Platform (Zhang et al., 2022)**:
- Focused on SaaS-based e-commerce solutions
- Limited to basic product management
- Did not address specialized market requirements

**Flexible Payment Systems in E-commerce (Lee & Kim, 2023)**:
- Explored alternative payment models
- Limited implementation details
- Did not integrate with complex product attributes

### 2.6.2 Commercial Solutions Comparison

| Platform | Multi-tenancy | Complex Attributes | Deposit Payments | Open Source |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Shopify Plus | Limited | Basic | No | No |
| Magento Commerce | Yes | Moderate | Plugin-based | Community |
| WooCommerce | No | Moderate | Plugin-based | Yes |
| This Project | Full | Advanced | Native | Yes |

## 2.7 Theoretical Framework

### 2.7.1 Software Engineering Principles

This project applies several key software engineering principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between presentation, business, and data layers
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Open/Closed Principle**: System design allows extension without modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules

### 2.7.2 Database Design Principles

Database design follows established principles:
- **Normalization**: Data is normalized to reduce redundancy
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency
- **Performance Optimization**: Strategic indexing for query performance
- **Scalability**: Design supports horizontal and vertical scaling

## 2.8 Research Contribution and Innovation

This project contributes to existing knowledge in several ways:

1. **Specialized Multi-tenancy**: Novel approach to multi-tenant architecture for niche markets
2. **Dynamic Attribute Management**: Advanced system for handling complex product variations
3. **Integrated Payment Flexibility**: Native support for deposit-based payment models
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimized database design for complex e-commerce operations

## 2.9 Literature Review Conclusion

The literature review establishes that while existing e-commerce platforms provide solid foundations for online commerce, they lack specialized features required for handmade product businesses. This project addresses identified gaps through innovative technical solutions and comprehensive system design.

The theoretical framework established through this review guides the system design and implementation described in subsequent chapters.
